**Mu-An Chiou** <small>(**邱慕安**)</small>. 

I am a designer at [GitHub](https://github.com) and co-founder of [Zeczec](http://zeczec.com). 

I am a **Taiwanese** from Taipei, have been in the UK for the past 5 years, currently based in **London**.

I started (trying) to do what I do now when I was 11, got into **French** in university but quickly dropped out, studied **Product Design** later instead, then went back doing web after graduated. 

I like web much more, because on the internet you **see the result much quicker**, and I don't have patience. You can find some of my product design works [here](http://be.net/muan).

For my fellow internet dwellers, I'm on 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/muanchiou),
[GitHub](https://github.com/muan),
[Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/muan), and
[Instagram](http://instagram.com/muanchiou).
There's a [XML Feed](/feed.xml) for my posts, and [this site is opensource](https://github.com/muan/muan.github.com) on GitHub.
