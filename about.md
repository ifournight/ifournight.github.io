I am a Front-end developer located in Chengdu, China. 

##Experience

###2011.7 - 2012.8
Quit my job, bought a Macbook Pro, start learning programming and iOS development from **Zero**

###2012.8 - 2013.8
**SOHO** for **1** year, began to write a iOS app called [Documentation](https://github.com/ifournight/Documentation)(An Apple Documentation Reader on iPad), unfortuntaly I suspended the project and the app never stepped into App Store.

###2013.8 - 2014.1
Didn't get a job as a iOS developer as planned, instead I have become a web Front-end novice developer. Working hard at china department of [Monstar](http://monstar-lab.com/).

###Future
For the next year, my target is to become a qualified and experienced Front-end developer.
For my entire life, everything just start and nothing is settled.
